# proj3-water-game_Python

Creating an interactive text game. A group project, but each of us was in charge of each section. A game where we added coins after the game was finished. Considering the collaborative environment, even though I am in charge of a section, it was required that I need to consider the other factors that would allow this game to run smoothly and the coins to add up correctly. This was a case-sensitive project. 

Skills demonstrated in this Python project: 
- Used interactive commands to interact with the user
- Used randomization to add flavor to the game
- Prevented loop occurrences in the game as it is interactive, using if-elif-else's
