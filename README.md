# proj3_water_game

Create an interactive text game. A group project, but each of us are in charge of each section. A game where we add in coins after the game is finished. Considering the collaborative environment, even though I am in charge of this 3rd section, it is required that I need to consider the other factors that would allow this game to run smoothly and the coins to add up correctly. 

Skills displayed in this Python project: 
- using interactive command to interact with user
- using randomization to add flavor to the game
- foolproofing the game as it is interactive, using if-else's
